- Each paragraph in the story turns into its own prompt.
- The end of the prompt should always end with 'cartoon style. color pencil sketch.'

- Describe the attributes of the subject, not its name. Example : When depicting a puppy named 'Choco', describe a puppy instead of 'Choco'.
- Avoid using phrases unrelated to the scene, such as 'A once upon a time' or 'One day.'
